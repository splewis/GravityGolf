GravityGolf is a 2-d game that simulates the movement of objects in space, where they are affected by the gravitational pull of other planets.

The goal of the game is to launch the ball (typically a small red ball) to a Goal (usually white). 

The basic permise of the game is relatively simple; the above mechanics are implemented is less than 100 lines of code.
However, the addition of many small features into one proejct has made management and design significant challanges.

Some of the small features of the game:
 - Graphical effects (ball trail, particle effects on collisions)
 - Speed settings
 - All settings made persistant for a user (saved to and reloaded from settings.txt)
 - Save/load game support
 
 A built release-version of the game is the Release folder. 
 GravityGolf.jar launches the game.
